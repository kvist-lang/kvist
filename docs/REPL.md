# REPL and Live Development

The Kvist REPL evaluates ordinary Kvist in a persistent native session.
Definitions, values, imports, macros, package state, and the three most recent
results remain available between submissions. Static types, ownership rules,
and Odin interoperability are the same as in a compiled program.

## Start a Session

Build Kvist, then give the REPL a source file from the project you want to work
with:

```sh
odin build src/cli/kvist -o:speed
./kvist repl examples/language/hello.kvist
```

The file establishes the package, imports, and symbols available to the
session. Larger applications commonly use a small `dev/user.kvist` file that
imports the code under development and defines development helpers.

The session does not start with an empty package. Declarations from the saved
context file and its package graph are available immediately, so there is no
need to evaluate the whole buffer before trying forms in a `(comment ...)`
block. Evaluate a definition or the buffer when you want the live session to
use a current, possibly unsaved declaration as a session-local definition;
unsaved declaration edits are not installed merely by starting the session.

```text
Kvist native REPL
Enter one expression per line; use :reset or :quit.
kvist=> (+ 1 1)
2
kvist=> (defn square [x: int] -> int (* x x))
kvist=> (square 11)
121
```

The terminal accepts one complete expression per line. Editor clients can send
balanced multi-line forms or a group of forms together.

## Work with a Session

Successful definitions are immediately available to later submissions.
Compatible redefinitions affect later calls:

```text
kvist=> (defn scale [x: int] -> int (* x 2))
kvist=> (scale 21)
42
kvist=> (defn scale [x: int] -> int (* x 3))
kvist=> (scale 21)
63
```

An interactively submitted `def` or `defvar` becomes typed storage retained
across native generations, so runtime values need explicit types. Compile-time
type aliases and overload sets do not require a retained value type.

Value-producing forms rotate through `*1`, `*2`, and `*3`. Runtime forms run
once; previous submissions are not replayed to rebuild session state.

A failed compilation leaves earlier session state intact. A crash in submitted
native code restarts the worker and clears runtime state. Use `:reset` to clear
the session deliberately and `:quit` to stop it.

Some submissions take longer than others, particularly the first use of a
large imported project. Kvist accelerates common interactive work where it can
do so without changing language behavior and otherwise uses its normal native
compiler path. This choice should normally be invisible apart from latency.

For isolated evaluation that must not observe session history, use:

```sh
kvist eval file.kvist '(form)'
```

## Work with Odin

The REPL can provide a typed, persistent development surface over ordinary
Odin code. A Kvist definition may contain an Odin body and still be redefined
and called like any other session function:

```clojure
(defn odin-step [value: int] -> int
  (odin "return value * 2 + 1"))

(odin-step 5)
;; => 11
```

For larger implementations, keep the code in normal `.odin` files, import the
package directory, and define only the interactive helpers you need in Kvist:

```clojure
(import native "./native")

(defn native-double [value: int] -> int
  (native.double value))
```

A project may therefore remain mostly Odin while using a small `dev/user.kvist`
as its live development entry point. An isolated `(odin "...")` at the prompt
is useful for an experiment, but its local declarations do not persist into
later submissions. Put reusable Odin inside a typed Kvist definition or an
`.odin` package.

The runnable [REPL/Odin example](../examples/interop/repl-odin.kvist) shows
embedded control flow, Odin calling Kvist, an imported Odin-only package, and
compatible redefinition. See [Odin interoperability](odin.md) for the broader
package model.

## Editors

The [Emacs client](../emacs/README.md) provides source-buffer evaluation,
completion, documentation, retained-value inspection, stepping, traces,
conditions, restarts, and project-scoped sessions.

Kvist also provides an experimental nREPL adapter for Calva and CIDER:

```sh
./kvist nrepl examples/language/hello.kvist
```

Use a real application entry file or development context so the server knows
which package graph and source files belong to the session. See the
[nREPL editor guide](NREPL.md) for setup and current limitations.

Other editor clients can use the JSONL protocol:

```sh
./kvist repl examples/language/hello.kvist --protocol jsonl
```

## Experimental: Attach to a Reload-Enabled Application

The normal REPL runs code in its own worker, so it does not share the live
state of an already-running application. Applications built around
`kvist:reload` can instead expose a private local endpoint and service REPL
requests at explicit safe points:

```sh
KVIST_REPL_ENDPOINT=.kvist/repl kvist run app.kvist --reload
kvist repl app.kvist --attach .kvist/repl --protocol jsonl
```

The application must reach `reload.checkpoint!` regularly. At a checkpoint, an
attached editor can evaluate code inside the application process, inspect live
values, invoke capabilities registered by the application, or request a
reload. Olive uses this mechanism for integrated live development, but it is
not part of the ordinary standalone REPL workflow.

See the [reload step example](../examples/reload/reload_step_demo/) for the
application structure. Because attached evaluations run inside the host, a
panic or crash in submitted code can terminate the application.

## Expectations and Boundaries

- A clean `check`, `test`, or `run` remains the reproducible truth. REPL
  history is development state, not an implicit part of the program.
- Compatible redefinitions affect later session calls. Code already running
  continues with the definitions it started with.
- Pointer and opaque resource results are retained only when Kvist has a safe
  lifecycle for them.
- Loaded code and session allocations are reclaimed by `:reset` or when the
  session exits.

If a result differs from a clean run, or a submission appears unexpectedly
slow, `--execution native` is available as a diagnostic comparison. It is not
needed for normal REPL use.
